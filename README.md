## My personal site

Built with:
- React
- React-Three-Fiber
- Emotion

<hr />

This is a v2.0 of my personal site where I render essentially the same page in 3D.

Each face of the cube is interactable HTML! That was... the tricky part.

Big thanks to the people at Poimandres for their extensive documentation and examples.

### Can I copy this?
Not in its entirety, but you can of course take anything you might find useful in building something original.

### Is this maintained?
I update/add to this every couple months or so.
