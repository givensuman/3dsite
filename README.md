<hr />

This is an update to my personal site where I render essentially the same page in 3D.

Remarkably, this didn't take as long as I'd think. Big thanks to the people at Poimandres for their extensive documentation and examples.

#### Can I copy this?
Not in its entirety, but you can of course take anything you might find useful in building something original.

#### Is this maintained?
I will definitely add more to this when I get the chance.
