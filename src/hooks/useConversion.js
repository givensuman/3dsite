// Basically, three.js units are arbitrary, and because we want to 
// render DOM stuff we need a way to consistently convert units into 
// pixels and vice versa for model rendering. Based on the components 
// I've made, a conversion of about 155px = 1 unit works well, for whatever 
// reason. Initially, I was sending the side length of the cube to 
// every component and then just fiddling with numbers to get things 
// into place based on that length so that they would resize in the 
// same 3D spot. Obviously, that was a bad plan. Now, this context 
// exports { u, p } which are functions to convert between the two.
// These exports use PERCENTAGES of the side length. Use p in
// DOM components, such that p(100) would be a full side worth of
// pixels, like height: 100%. Use u in models, such that a
// position in +x space of u(50) is half the cube face in the x axis
